1. you should be able to shoot weapon (some of the old version aka v0.3 was overriding weapon profile)
2. all the enemy bots must be modified in scenario with multiple bots 
3. duration of the scenario should be same as original (unless duration variants)
4. in duration variants, the theoretical max score should be same as original
5. timescale variant should have same duration as the original scenario (this is problem in v0.7)



things to note
1. kovaak's does ingame calculation to display actual value player experience in game - this is different to what's written inside sce file.
